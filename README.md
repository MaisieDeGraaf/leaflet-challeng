# Leaflet Challenge

This project visualizes earthquake data using Leaflet, a JavaScript library for interactive maps. It fetches earthquake data from the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program API and displays it on an interactive map. Additionally, it overlays tectonic plate boundaries on the map for context.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Navigate to the project directory

3. Open the index.html file in your web browser to view the interactive map.

## Features

- Displays earthquake data fetched from the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program API on the most significant earthquakres within the last month.

- Visualizes earthquake locations using circle markers with colors corresponding to earthquake depths.

- Provides interactive popups with detailed information about each earthquake (magnitude, location, tsunami status, ID, and time).

- Overlays tectonic plate boundaries on the map for context.

- Supports different base map layers (satellite, topographic, street map).

## Technologies Used

- Leaflet.js
- D3.js
- HTML/CSS
  
## Credits

This project utilizes earthquake data from the [USGS Earthquake Hazards Program](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards) and tectonic plate boundary data from [Techtonic Plate Data by Github Fraxen](https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates).
